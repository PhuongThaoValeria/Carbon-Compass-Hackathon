        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">1. What is the purpose of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            CBAM is designed to prevent carbon leakage — the relocation of carbon-intensive production outside
            the EU to countries with weaker climate rules. It ensures imported goods face a carbon cost similar
            to EU-made goods under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), supporting the EU’s targets of a 55% emissions
            reduction by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">2. How does CBAM work in practice?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Importers of covered goods must report the embedded emissions of those goods, and starting in 2026
            they will need to purchase CBAM certificates. The price of these certificates mirrors the EU carbon
            price. If a producer has already paid a carbon price in the exporting country, that amount is deducted
            to avoid paying twice. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">3. What is the current phase of CBAM implementation?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            CBAM entered its transitional phase on 1 October 2023. During this phase, importers submit quarterly
            emission reports but do not pay yet. The definitive phase begins in 2026, when payment through CBAM
            certificates starts. Policy updates in 2025 suggest the full obligation could be pushed toward 2027
            and simplified for small importers. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">4. Which sectors and products are currently covered by CBAM?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            CBAM currently applies to six high-emission areas: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers,
            hydrogen, and electricity. These sectors were chosen due to their high carbon intensity and high
            risk of carbon leakage. The scope may later expand to downstream products such as fasteners,
            alloys, and recycled material streams. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">5. What do importers have to report during the transitional period?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Importers (or their indirect customs representatives) must submit quarterly reports describing:
            (a) how much of each CBAM good was imported,
            (b) the direct and indirect embedded emissions,
            and (c) any carbon price already paid in the country of origin. Reports are due one month after
            the end of each quarter. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">6. What reforms did the EU introduce in 2025?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            The European Parliament backed several simplifications:
            a higher de minimis threshold of 50 tons/year (which could exempt around 90% of small importers by volume),
            permission to use default emission values,
            development of default country-level carbon price values,
            and the option to delay full CBAM rollout toward 2027.
            These changes aim to reduce burden on SMEs and improve fairness. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">7. How does CBAM affect developing and lower-income countries?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can be highly exposed because their economies often rely
            on CBAM sectors like cement and fertilisers, but they may lack the systems to measure and verify
            emissions. Small and medium suppliers in these countries risk being pushed out of EU value chains
            if they cannot provide compliant data. Some studies estimate income losses of up to 0.5% for certain
            African economies, which is why there are calls for EU technical and financial support. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">8. What happens to the money collected through CBAM?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            CBAM is expected to generate around €2.1 billion per year. While these funds currently feed mainly
            into the EU budget, many experts argue that a portion should support international climate finance —
            for example, helping exporting countries invest in cleaner industrial processes and measurement,
            reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">9. Are there penalties for not complying with CBAM reporting?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Yes. During the transitional phase, failing to report embedded emissions — or submitting incomplete
            or incorrect data and not correcting it — can lead to penalties of €10 to €50 per tonne of unreported
            emissions. National competent authorities are responsible for enforcement and may require corrections
            before issuing fines. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">10. How is the EU trying to make CBAM fairer globally?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            The EU’s policy discussions highlight five priorities:
            (1) simplify compliance for SMEs and developing countries,
            (2) extend CBAM to more products to avoid loopholes,
            (3) fund technical and financial support so exporting countries can measure and cut emissions,
            (4) recognize equivalent foreign carbon pricing or verified green investments,
            and (5) dedicate part of CBAM revenues to global decarbonization.
            The goal is to align climate ambition with fairness. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
