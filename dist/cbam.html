      <h2>EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)</h2>

      <h3>1. What is CBAM?</h3>
      <p>
        The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is the European Union’s policy introduced in 2023 
        to prevent “carbon leakage” — when companies relocate production outside the EU to avoid carbon costs. 
        It ensures that imported goods face the same carbon price as those produced within the EU, 
        maintaining fairness and supporting the EU’s climate neutrality goal.
      </p>

      <h3>2. How CBAM Works</h3>
      <p>
        During the transitional phase (from October 2023 to the end of 2025), importers are only required 
        to report the amount of CO₂ embedded in their products. 
        From 2026 onward, they must purchase <strong>CBAM certificates</strong> corresponding to the emissions associated with their imports. 
        If the product has already been subject to a carbon price in its country of origin, that amount will be deducted 
        to avoid double taxation.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Sectors Covered</h3>
      <p>
        CBAM currently applies to six high-emission sectors: 
        <em>iron and steel, cement, fertilizers, aluminium, hydrogen, and electricity.</em> 
        In the future, it is expected to expand to “downstream” products such as alloys, components, 
        and recycled materials.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Understanding Carbon Emissions</h3>
      <p>
        “Carbon emissions” refer to greenhouse gases—primarily CO₂—released during production, 
        transportation, or consumption processes. Measuring and reducing these emissions 
        are central to global efforts to combat climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CBAM, emissions are measured as <strong>embedded emissions</strong>, 
        meaning all CO₂ generated throughout the entire supply chain—from raw materials to the finished product.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Benefits and Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        CBAM promotes fairness among EU companies, encourages exporters to adopt cleaner production methods, 
        and contributes to global emission reduction. 
        However, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and small businesses (SMEs) may struggle with 
        emission monitoring and reporting due to limited data access and technical capacity.
      </p>

      <div class="cbam-highlight">
        <strong>Global Impact:</strong>  
        CBAM is more than an environmental tool—it is a trade game-changer that reshapes global supply chains, 
        pushing companies toward sustainable, transparent, and climate-responsible production.
      </div>

      <h3>6. A Greener Future Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        CBAM is projected to generate about <strong>€2.1 billion annually</strong> for the EU budget. 
        Experts recommend allocating part of this revenue to support developing countries 
        in green technology investment—ensuring a fair and inclusive energy transition.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 2027, CBAM is expected to be fully operational—becoming an integral part of the EU’s “Net Zero 2050” strategy.
